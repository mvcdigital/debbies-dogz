Saturday Kitchen - ooh I thought I'll make some healthy Puptastic Boosting Blueberry & Bashed Banana Biscuits .... nearly had our first "biscuit stress" (from using to large a banana which made the mixture very sloppy!!) we pulled it round with A LOT of extra flour and chilled the remaining dough for another batch tomorrow ..... Mo was being uber lazy and went back to bed this morning but Magic was very happy to oblige with bowl cleaning duties & tasting ...... Mo did grace me with his presence once they were cooked!!.... You snooze, you lose Sausage!!

**Healthy (ish) Banana & Blueberry Biscuits....**

1 banana (mashed)\
128g whole wheat flour (I used plain organic gluten free mixed)\
64g rolled oats\
50g well rinsed blueberries (I mashed mine in with the banana first before adding to "dry" ingredients\
1 egg\
85g peanut butter (dog friendly - no XYLITOL)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 180 - line large baking tray with baking paper.

All ingredients into bowl and mix until forms a ball of dough

Flour worksurface & knead for about 5 mins until it's all stretchy!.

Roll out to 1/2 thick (approx) and make shapes or use cutters.

Bake for 12-15 mins (approx) till turning golden brown, cool on wire rack.

Store in airtight container in the fridge for upto 10 days (if they last that long!!) 

Enjoy!
