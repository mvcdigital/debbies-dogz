My guilty pleasure very occasionally on a Saturday morning was to watch Saturday Morning Kitchen .... Yep you guessed it .... here's a little something from DebbiesDogz Doggy Diner!!

Magic, Mo & one of the cats watched, waited patiently & have taste tested some homemade biscuits - literally just store cupboard stuff, found the recipe online & intend to substitute & experiment with other textures & flavours in the next week or two!

Nothing fancy!! Washed up, made a cup of tea and they were ready.

**Cheddar Dog Biscuits**

130g flour (i used plain)\
130g shredded cheddar cheese (i used half parmesan, half cheddar)\
1 tablespoon butter, softened\
80ml approx whole milk

**Directions:**

In a small bowl, combine flour and cheese. Stir in butter until combined. Gradually add milk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 8-10 times.

Roll dough into a 12x9-in. rectangle; cut into 3x1-in. strips or go freestyle, use cutters or create your own shapes ![ðŸ¤©](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t58/1/16/1f929.png) Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350Â°/180 for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand in the oven with the door slightly open (if you leave your dog in a separate room!!) until cooled completely. Store in an airtight container up high!!
