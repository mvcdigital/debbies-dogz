So with all the sweet cakes & biscuits I've been baking I thought we'd go for a savoury "doggy dish of the day" - really easy to make - Meaty Muttloaf and Tiny Balls (!) Training treats - again store-cupboard ingredients used and substituted cottage cheese or cheddar (not quite as low fat maybe!)

Interestingly both dogs were not as interested in the preparation of these and preferred to sunbathe!! However, once they were cooked both dogs glued to my side instantly!

You can freeze both the meatloaf and the balls (excuse the pun) use for "jackpot" training achievements or give as an occasional special treat - Enjoy!

NB: The tiny balls make loads and I imagine will be a great way to get the kids involved and will certainly stop them from touching their faces as all mixed and made by hand!!

**Meaty Muttloaf**

250g lean minced beef (you can substitute for turkey, chicken or lamb)\
1 large egg\
75g rolled oats\
75g grated mixed vegetables of your choice (i used spinach, peas, carrot & sweet potato)\
50g cottage cheese (I used cheddar)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 180 degrees

Mix all ingredients together, put into a loaf tin (greased or lined with baking parchment)

Bake for 40 mins

Turn out, cool & slice (freeze slices for easy to use portions).

**Tiny Balls Treats (great for freezing & as training jackpot rewards)**

125ml milk\
50g rolled oats\
1 large egg\
50g grated parmesan (again I did not have any so used cheddar)\
250g lean minced beef\
250 minced sausage meat (i had none of this so used two cooked sausages I had left over - again you could substitute with other types of mince)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 180 degrees

Combine milk & oats and leave to "soak"

Mix egg, meat (s) & cheese together with your hands - then add milk/oats and mix up again.

Form into tiny balls (!)

Bake in the oven for approx 20 mins
