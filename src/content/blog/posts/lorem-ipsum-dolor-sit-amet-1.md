Good Evening All, so tonight rather than more training videos & enrichment ideas I thought I'd talk a little about SLEEP!!

It's been an emotional, anxiety ridden and stressful week for many, children home-schooling (or not!), trying to do your day to day job and then there is the DOG to consider (and no dog-walker at present!).....

For your dog it is also an enormous adjustment - most of them are used to sleeping during the day then BOOM overnight, all change .......

So let me set up a scenario for you - and the only way I can explain it without getting scientific is ...... your child has gone to sleep or is sitting quietly reading a book and their sibling keeps proding them ... lets play, what you doing?, I'm bored ...

If your dog is taking itself away from the family for some peace & quiet there is a reason - on average dogs need to sleep 12-14hrs per day, more so in puppies and also large breeds (this is scientifically proven), as with children, they need time to develop and sleep improves mood & learning ability....

As you all well know my two do a lot of walking & socialising with me BUT I give them the "choice" daily whether to come to work with me and they always have at least one day off (no walks just enrichment, snuffle mat, towel game) a week....

Also this was an interesting article in these stressful times......

Improves Sleep Quality

One study recently found that humans who slept with a dog in their bedroom kept a better routine and were able to sleep more efficiently. ... They found that humans had an 81 percent sleep efficiency and the dogs an 85 percent sleep efficiency.

Sleeping with a dog can lower blood pressure, anxiety & stress and for children reduces likelihood of nightmares - think about service dogs Pets As Therapy & Service Dogs.

Obviously this does depend on your dog & situation!!

So give your dog some time out too - this situation affects them as well as us
