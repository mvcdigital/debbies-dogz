  No entire males or bitches.

  All dogs must be fully vaccinated (or titre tested), Kennel Cough Vaccinated and have proof of a regular parasite and worming prevention program.

  All dogs will be assessed in their own home prior to introduction walk with Magic and Mo before joining Debbie’s Dogz group walking.

  Boarding is only offered to existing walking and daycare clients – 2 walks per week or one daycare per week for a minimum of 3 months. 

  A trial night/weekend will be required at least one month prior to boarding dates.

  Debbie’s Dogz does not offer adhoc walking/daycare or boarding.

  Any veterinary emergencies whilst in the care of Debbie’s Dogz will automatically be taken to Aston Clinton Veterinary Centre, who I have been using for over twenty years for both my own pets and now clients dogs.
