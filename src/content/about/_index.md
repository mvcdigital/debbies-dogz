      I have always had a deep love for dogs, growing up with a number of rescue
      dogs from the age of eleven. As soon as I had my own home I got my first
      rescue dog, Max (great dane x labrador) and so my want (and need!) to
      learn grew. My second rescue dog, Cadbury (Pointer x Dobermann), was a
      huge learning curve for me. I attended many, many seminars and workshops
      with world renowned trainers and behaviourists to broaden my understanding
      of his “issues,” whilst working as a full time PA.


      Fate then took over. I volunteered at Battersea Old Windsor walking the dogs at weekends, and by chance a temporary role to help out Home Visiting evenings and weekends became available, to chat to members of the public who were interested in rehoming a dog, advising them on settling in and working with their dog to build a happy lifetime partnership (I also rehomed my third rescue dog Henry (German Shepherd Cross). After a period of time, I was then offered the role on a full time permanent basis. I gave up my PA job and jumped head first into the amazing world of rescue, rehoming, training, assessing and behaviour with the best known rescue in the UK – Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. I spent 5 very happy years there, including a promotion to Rehoming Officer based at the main London site.

      I left Battersea due to poor health, did some temp secretarial work and
      then secured a position with Guide Dogs for the Blind as Rehoming Officer
      for another 4 years, dealing with rehoming dogs who did not prove suitable
      to remain on the scheme and also the retiring Guide Dogs, spending time
      with their Guide Dog Owners and interviewing and matching dogs with
      members of the public.


      I set up my walking business whilst I was a trainer with PuppyStars and also took the decision to break away and do training on my own. I have run classes but now concentrate on working with dogs and their owners on a one-to-one basis.


      I am the proud owner of Magic, a Pets As Therapy 10-year-old border collie (rescued at approximately 1 year old) and Mo, a 5-year-old Mini-Smooth Dachshund (rehomed to me at 3 years old) – who are my assessors of any new dogs joining our crew. My three cats – Peaches, Poppy and Dog – are the masters of teaching acceptable dog behaviour in their home when boarding with us!
