name: Jo and Alfie the Cavachon
summary: Debbie has a wonderful manner with animals and chooses her walking
  groups carefully, to suit the needs and personalities of the dogs in her care.
  Alfie has also boarded for a weekend and had such a great time he didn’t want
  to come home! Alfie absolutely adores Debbie and, whatever the weather, he
  cannot wait to join her and all his doggy pals when the fun-bus turns up! I
  would recommend Debbie’s Dogz every day of the week...

  We first met Debbie at puppy classes several years ago and she helped us
  immeasurably to train our first dog, Alfie. Since then, we’ve attended many of
  Debbie’s classes and were thrilled when she started her dog walking service,
  as she understands all of Alfie’s quirks and we knew he’d be in very safe
  hands.
