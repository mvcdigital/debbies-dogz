  There are very few people we trust to look after our fur-babies so you can
  imagine my delight when I found Debbie. If like me you’re looking for someone
  who loves dogs and knows how to work with them, Debbie is most certainly the
  one! I can’t thank Debbie enough for not only providing an excellent service:
  reliable, trustworthy, friendly, but above all else loving and caring for my
  cocker spaniel (Harvey) just like he was her own.


  Harvey is walked 5 days a week and has also been boarded by Debbie on several occasions; I’m always totally relaxed knowing that Harvey is in very good hands. He thoroughly enjoys his time with Debbie; she’s taken the time and interest to understand his quirky spaniel ways and needs; he totally adores her — he told me so!”
