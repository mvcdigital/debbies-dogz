  We try to incorporate training as FUN into our walks with games for recall and
  lots of find it games too. Walking groups are carefully matched so all dogs
  are safe and comfortable with the other dogs in their group. Any new dog will
  be slowly introduced to a group. Only two walking slots are offered a day,
  which are purposefully not run on a timescale so all dogs get the chance to
  chill out, sniff, run and play on their walks together. All Debbie's Dogz are
  supplied with a harness and identity tag for walks. All dogs are collected and
  dropped off from their homes.


  Minimum two walks per week or one daycare.
